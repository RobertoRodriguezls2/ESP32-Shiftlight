# ESP32 Shift Light
This project uses an ESP32 and uses its ability to multitask using both of its cores in order to communicate through Bluetooth and wifi, an ELM327 and a strip of WS2812b LEDs are also used in this project. On one of the cores the ESP32 first searches for an ELM327 that is plugged into a cars OBII port to connect to and once connected the ESP32 will display a message notifying that it has been connected. The ESP32 will then show the RPMs being read from the ELM327. After connecting to the ELM327, on another core the ESP32 creates a wifi point and starts hosting a local website that was created using React. When connected the user can edit the Low, Mid, and High end of the RPM scale which triggers when the LED's turn on their respective colors. The user is able to edit these values in real time through post requests being sent to the ESP32s server. Values entered are stored and saved on the ESP32 for when the device is powered off and on again

## WIfi point & React App

The ESP32 creates an access point which can be connected to. Once connected to, entering the ESP32s IP address into a browser will connect a user to the React app hosted on the ESP32. From here a user can enter values which change the scaling of the LED's activation points in real time. These values are sent through post requests from the react app and saved in the ESP32s SPIFFS for when the device is powered off. The web page has a test rpm value that can be entered to verify that the LEDs are working aswell as being connected to the ELM327.
